This is a basic 4 bit ALU with 8 opcodes

TODO: 
- refactor code to use case statement instead of if else structure
- implement in cadence X
-- this was completed with 8 bit input instead of 4. still need to finish implementing drive on/off to only turn on add/sub block and shift block when appropriate. Logic is good, but drive sizes need optimized.
